## Languages
- [K](K/README.md)
- [ACL2](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~moore/acl2/)

  > ACL2 is a logic and programming language in which you can model computer systems, together with a tool to help you prove properties of those models. "ACL2" denotes "A Computational Logic for Applicative Common Lisp".

REMS:
- [Sail architecture definition language](https://github.com/rems-project/sail)

  > Sail has been used for Arm-A, Morello (CHERI-Arm), RISC-V, CHERI-RISC-V, CHERIoT, x86, CHERI x86, MIPS, CHERI-MIPS, and IBM Power. In most cases these are full definitions (e.g. able to boot an OS in the Sail-generated emulator), but x86, CHERI x86 and IBM Power are core user-mode fragments, and the last is in an older legacy version of Sail.
